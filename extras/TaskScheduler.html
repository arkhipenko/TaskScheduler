<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Tasks</B> perform
certain functions, which could require periodic or one-time
execution, update of specific variables, or waiting for specific
events. Tasks also could be controlling specific hardware, or
triggered by hardware interrupts. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For execution purposes
<B>Tasks</B> are linked into execution <B>chains</B>, which are

(linked together).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Starting with
version 2.0.0 TaskScheduler supports task prioritization. Please
refer to the specific chapter of this manual for details on layered
prioritization. </B>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each task performs its
function via a callback method. Scheduler calls Task’s callback
method periodically until task is disabled or runs out of iterations.
In addition to “regular” callback method, two additional methods
could be utilized for each task: a callback method invoked every time
the task is enabled, and a callback method invoked once when the task
is disabled. Those two special methods allow tasks to properly
initiate themselves for execution, and clean-up after execution is
over (E.g., setup pin modes on enable, and always bring pin level to
LOW at the end). 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tasks are responsible
for supporting <B>cooperative</B> <B>multitasking</B> by being “good
neighbors”, i.e., running their callback methods quickly in a
non-blocking way, and releasing control back to scheduler as soon as
possible. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Scheduler</B> is
executing Tasks' callback methods in the order the tasks were added
to the chain, from first to last. Scheduler stops and exists after
processing the chain once in order to allow other statements in the
main code of <B>loop()</B> method to run.  This is referred to as a
<B>“scheduling pass”.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(Normally, there is no
need to have any other statements in the <B>loop</B>() method other
than the Scheduler's <B>execute</B>() method).</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>TaskScheduler</B>
library maybe compiled with different compilation controls
enabled/disabled. This is a way to limit TaskScheduler functionality
(and size) for specific purpose (sketch). This is achieved by
defining specific #<B>define</B> parameters <I>before</I>
TaskScheduler.h header file. Specifically:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If compiled with
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">_TASK_SLEEP_ON_IDLE_RUN</FONT>
enabled, the scheduler will place processor into IDLE sleep mode (for
approximately 1 ms, as the timer interrupt will wake it up), after
what is determined to be an “idle” pass. An Idle Pass is a pass
through the task chain when no Tasks were scheduled to run their
callback methods. This is done to avoid repetitive idle passes
through the chain when no tasks need to be executed. If any of the
tasks in the chain always requires immediate execution (aInterval =
0), then there will be no IDLE sleep between task's callback method
execution.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>NOTE: </B>Task
Scheduler uses <B>millis()</B> to determine if tasks are ready to be
invoked. Therefore, if you put your device to any “deep” sleep
mode disabling timer interrupts, the <B>millis()</B> count will be
suspended, leading to effective suspension of scheduling. Upon wake
up, active tasks need to be re-enabled, which will effectively reset
their internal time scheduling variables to the new value of
<B>millis(). </B>Time spent in deep sleep mode should be considered
“frozen”, i.e., if a task was scheduled to run in 1 second from
now, and device was put to sleep for 5 minutes, upon wake up, the
task will still be scheduled 1 second from the time of wake up.
Executing <B>enable() </B>method on this tasks will make it run as
soon as possible. This is a concern only for tasks which are required
to run in a truly periodical manner (in absolute time terms).

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition to
time-only (<B>millis</B>() only)  invocation, tasks can be scheduled
to wait on an event employing StatusRequest objects (more about
Status Requests later).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Consider a scenario
when one task (t1) is performing a function which affects execution
of many tasks (t2, t3). In this case the task t1 will “signal”
completion of its function via Status Request object. Tasks t2 and t3
are “waiting” on the same Status Request object. As soon as
status request completes, t2 and t3 are activated.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time critical option
keeps track when current execution took place relative to when it was

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Task::getStartDelay()
</B>method: return number of milliseconds between current system time
(millis) and point in time when the task was scheduled to start. A

too short (and therefore schedule is too aggressive).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A positive value
indicates that task is on schedule, and callback methods have enough

within the task, Control Points could be defined to further help with
pinpointing potential problem areas. For instance, the tasks which
deal with external resources (sensors, serial communications,
anything hardware dependent) can be blocked (or hung), by failed
hardware. In this case, a watchdog timer could be employed to trap
such a failed task, and identify which one (by task id) and where in
the task (by a control point) the problem is likely located.</P>

LTS pointer to the appropriate pointer type.

prioritization is achieved by creating several schedulers, and

priority in execution in case of the scheduling coincidence. More

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Starting with version

hence the concept of priority layers. Tasks subsequently are assigned
to schedulers corresponding to their desired priority. The lowest
priority Scheduler is called “<B>base scheduler</B>” or “<B>base
layer</B>”. Let’s call higher priority schedulers by their
priority number, with larger number corresponding to higher priority
of task execution.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Task prioritization is

a pre-emptive multi-tasking library. Nor is it a Real-Time OS. There

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This has, however,
significant benefits: you don't need to worry about concurrency
inside the callback method, since only one callback method runs at a
time, and could not be interrupted. All resources are yours for that
period of time, no one can switch the value of variables (except
interrupt functions of course...), etc. It is a stable and
predictable environment, and it helps a lot with writing stable code.

enabled and check if your tasks are falling behind schedule. If they
are - you need to optimize your code further (or maybe re-evaluate
your schedule). If they are not - all is well and you don't need to
do anything. E.g., I have a spider robot which needs to measure
distance, control motors, and keep track of the angle via querying
gyroscope and accelerometer every 10 ms. The idea was to flash
onboard LED if any of the tasks fall behind. At 10 ms interval for
the gyro the LED does not flash, which means none of the tasks are
blocking the others from starting on time.
